## Usage

### Compiling
```bash
g++ -o stalin_sort stalin_sort.cpp
```

### Running
```bash
./stalin_sort
```

## Features
- Generic template implementation supporting any comparable type
- Type-safe using C++ templates
- Works with integers, strings, and any type that supports the >= operator

## Requirements
- G++ or any C++ compiler (C++11 or later)
- C++ standard library
